# Security policy

I do my best to my knowledge to provide maximum security for you when you're
using my projects.

**I can promise you that I will not break any of your digital privacy rights.**
I mean no tracking, no third-party trackers, no friggin Facebook pixel,
no Google Analytics, or whatever else exists these days.
I want to feel safe and my privacy to be respected on the Internet as much as
you do.
Let's be humans, not products.

Keep in mind that I learn something new every day,
and it's up to you to help me keep this promise,
when there's something that I am unaware of.
If any promise was broken, it was unintentional.

## Reporting a vulnerability or breach of privacy rights

If you have found a security issue or have any concern or doubts regarding
it or privacy rights, **please contact me as soon as possible** via email:

new.
