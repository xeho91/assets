# Security policy

I do my best to my knowledge to provide maximum security for you when you're
using my projects.

**I can promise you that I will not break any of your digital privacy rights.**
I mean no tracking, no third-party trackers, no friggin Facebook
pixel, no Google Analytics, or whatever else exists these days. I want to feel
safe, and my privacy to be respected on the Internet as much as you do. Lets be
humans, not products.

## Reporting a vulnerability or breach of privacy rights

If you have found a security issue or have any concern or doubts regarding
privacy rights, please contact me via email: xeho91@pm.me. I'm all ears and
open to learning something new.

## Thank you

you're the best, thank you! :heart:
